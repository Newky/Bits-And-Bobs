May 20 15:03:42 <EspadaV8>	cchristiansen++

May 20 15:03:43 <Twister_Kuriboh>	:), using xfce (was going to use lxde, but i hate the plainness on a non-ubutnu system)

May 20 15:03:44 <popey>	irssi

May 20 15:03:44 <degville>	ahahaha

May 20 15:03:46 <popey>	[FACT]

May 20 15:03:47 <sbox>	we are good at raging

May 20 15:03:48 <warmana>	IRC online meet for LXF is a cool idea.

May 20 15:03:48 <EspadaV8>	irssi

May 20 15:03:49 <degville>	i'm using konversation

May 20 15:03:52 <degville>	which is pretty good

May 20 15:03:53 <braintooth>	dont know

May 20 15:03:54 <EspadaV8>	kde, vim, irssi, arch

May 20 15:03:54 <bobthebob1234>	What's the best IRC client?: http://webchat.freenode.net/

May 20 15:03:55 <AndreasFrom>	I'll say Gnome 3, my computers is a couple of years old and doesn't run Unity!!?

May 20 15:03:55 <Twister_Kuriboh>	xchat ;)

May 20 15:03:55 <felissilvestris>	Gnome 3 has driven me to xfce, just wish I'd adopted it sooner, and vi

May 20 15:03:59 <M-Saunders>	I wrote an IRC client called Tatanga once

May 20 15:04:04 <Twister_Kuriboh>	best, mibbit XD

May 20 15:04:05 <M-Saunders>	I'll see if I can dig out a screenshot

May 20 15:04:07 <popey>	AndreasFrom: tried Unity2D?

May 20 15:04:11 <cchristiansen>	Remember chatzilla?

May 20 15:04:13 <JonTheNiceGuy>	M-Saunders: ii's pretty cool, but a little *too* geeky for most people

May 20 15:04:18 <Twister_Kuriboh>	i do (kinda)

May 20 15:04:20 <thameslink>	installed ayttm specially to come here

May 20 15:04:20 <degville>	my main problem with tatanga was that it wasn't threaded. you had to press enter to update the display

May 20 15:04:22 <tristan2468>	I keep meaning to get into xfce. I can't really get on with Gnome 3 or Unity

May 20 15:04:26 <EspadaV8>	although the desktop is mostly moot, since the cli is where it's at

May 20 15:04:28 <AndreasFrom>	popey: I'm using that, on Arch now though :)

May 20 15:04:38 <M-Saunders>	degville: Wow, you clearly used it so much!

May 20 15:04:39 <Twister_Kuriboh>	same :)

May 20 15:04:42 <popey>	AndreasFrom: Unity 2D on arch?

May 20 15:04:48 <Twister_Kuriboh>	XD

May 20 15:10:50 <jemark>	M-Saunders, my flash plugin only uses alsa, not pulse audio on Slackware :(

May 20 15:17:32 <M-Saunders>	sbox: Oh right, sorry, forgot about that conversation!

May 20 15:17:39 <jellyman>	M-Saunder Unity is the reason I went to KDE.

May 20 15:17:39 <Twister_Kuriboh>	ok then, hello

May 20 15:18:06 <EspadaV8>	i'm no gnome user, so i might've missed things, but has there been any talk of forking gnome 2 to carry it on?

May 20 15:18:20 <Darth_Tux2328>	yeah, mint is continuing to use 2

May 20 15:18:22 <nucc1>	EspadaV8, why are you interested?

May 20 15:18:31 <BeerW0lf>	Unity looks like something to be used with a touch screen. I prefer the classic desktop experience with mouse and keyboard.

May 20 15:18:34 <M-Saunders>	Why so much Spanish? Können wir nicht vielleicht a bisserl auf Deutsch plaudern?

May 20 15:18:34 <sbox>	mike cool! then you should also look at the epic command: ceni

May 20 15:18:35 <EspadaV8>	i know people said they were going to do that with kde3 but nothing happened

May 20 15:18:36 <popey>	I expect a fair number of people will "defect" to other distros / desktops as a result of Unity in 11.04. I also predict many will come back at 11.10 or 12.04. (perhaps sounds arrogant, not meant to be)

May 20 15:18:39 <EspadaV8>	nucc1: no, just wondering

May 20 15:18:41 <degville>	Theodore: hello!

May 20 15:18:44 <nucc1>	popey, i defected to fedora

May 20 15:18:44 <scott_n>	Mint will be using gnome 2 for mint 11 but will probably go to gnome 3 for mint 12

May 20 15:18:47 <JonRob>	EspadaV8 - there was, but it died after a week or two

May 20 15:18:52 <qwebirc52138>	Unity is "Aimed at the moms and Dads" according to Jono Bacon

May 20 15:18:56 <Twister_Kuriboh>	yep, one of the reasons that i defected to arch linux (um kinda)

May 20 15:18:57 <popey>	nucc1: specifically because of Unity

May 20 15:18:57 <cchristiansen>	M-Saunders: Na klar können wir ;)

May 20 15:19:01 <nucc1>	popey, yes.

May 20 15:19:02 <EspadaV8>	JonRob: lol, motivation fail

May 20 15:19:05 <popey>	qwebirc52138: pffft, what does that loser jono know? :D

May 20 15:19:07 <LXF_Andrew>	nucc1: No, Unity. I've never used LibreOffice since I discovered AbiWord back in the day. Even now I have a much more powerful machine I'll stick with AbiWord

May 20 15:19:08 <M-Saunders>	cchristiansen: Prima! Do wohnst in Deutschland oder?

May 20 15:19:09 <bobthebob1234>	BeerW0lf: It is great on a touch screen, everything else it is crap on

May 20 15:19:11 <degville>	unity and gnome shell are both broken thanks to dist-upgrade on my box.

May 20 15:19:21 <Darth_Tux2328>	Do any distros use Gnome 3 by default now??

May 20 15:19:23 <cchristiansen>	M-Saunders: Nein, Yorkshire :P

May 20 15:19:27 <scott_n>	fedora 15

May 20 15:19:32 <M-Saunders>	cchristiansen: Oh, alreet then :-)

May 20 15:19:32 <JonRob>	EspadaV8 - think he just realised it was a *mad* amount of work, especially when there's xfce ;_

May 20 15:19:33 <Darth_Tux2328>	cool!

May 20 15:19:34 <qwebirc52138>	I'm sticking with 10.04LTS for a while

May 20 15:19:53 <AndreasFrom>	Darth_Tux2328: Fedora 15 when it comes out

May 20 15:19:55 <nucc1>	LXF_Andrew, ah, abiword is a miserable clone of MS Office 2000. Libreoffice is very stable and fully functional for me now.

May 20 15:19:56 <popey>	spamsnake: yeah, we put big warnings about that out

May 20 15:20:02 <M-Saunders>	My Ubuntu 11.04 upgrade totally wrecked my installation

May 20 15:20:03 <Twister_Kuriboh>	sigh... that's why i use xfce (or lxde)

May 20 15:20:05 <M-Saunders>	Thanks Ubuntu!

May 20 15:20:09 <Darth_Tux2328>	thanks

May 20 15:20:10 <scott_n>	Fedora 15 comes out n Tuesday

May 20 15:20:12 <cchristiansen>	M-Saunders: Lived in Germany last year though so..

May 20 15:20:13 <qwebirc52138>	GNOME 3 is still buggy under Ubuntu

May 20 15:20:18 <M-Saunders>	cchristiansen: Cool, whereabouts?

May 20 15:20:18 <popey>	spamsnake: unity is built on GNOME 2, no getting away from that, in 11.10 its built on GNOME 3 so that problem goes away.

May 20 15:20:18 <Twister_Kuriboh>	um, lol

May 20 15:20:32 <thameslink>	I installed 11.04 to have a play about with unity, it's not as got as the old unr launcher and it keeps saying my battery maybe broken

May 20 15:23:16 <degville>	JonRob: nope. but i do brew my own when i get a chance. the only problem is i never clean out the barrel, so the one in my garage currently has 6 month old sediment in it.

May 20 15:24:17 <popey>	By the way, has to be said M-Saunders / Effy / degville / JonRob - you put a very fun show together. Tuxradar is one of the few podcasts I will listen to first, before others.

May 20 15:24:22 <M-Saunders>	JonRob: Kits are like 20 quid now, aren't they? Although I guess you need the tubs and stuff

May 20 15:25:43 <braintooth>	love, not lol

May 20 15:25:43 <sbox>	TUXRADAR IS THE BEST EVEN IN CAPS LOCK 

May 20 15:25:56 <M-Saunders>	CAPS LOCK FOR TEH WINZ0RS

May 20 15:25:58 <popey>	I totally misread that "CAPS LOCK" then

May 20 15:26:07 <DoubleDiode>	How about a vodcast?

May 20 15:26:12 <EspadaV8>	tbh, i think that might also be because it's every 2 weeks, so i only get half the TR lovin'

May 20 15:26:14 <M-Saunders>	DoubleDiode: I'm not pretty enough

May 20 15:26:16 <popey>	davmor2: there are no other shows. tuxradar is the only show ;)

May 20 15:28:09 <LXF_Andrew>	We were thinking abut hiving a section off from the main podcast to fill the gap between shows, but it would only be 5 minutes worth or so. Does that sound good, or would it be annoying?

May 20 15:28:11 <spamsnake>	M-Saunders: Awesome!

May 20 15:28:11 <popey>	apparently

May 20 15:28:15 <M-Saunders>	popey: Yeah. And Beanz is the currency!

May 20 15:28:18 <sbox>	PULSEAUDIO FTW (flamewar incomming)

May 20 15:28:20 <EspadaV8>	M-Saunders: I should add that to my list of things to learn

May 20 15:28:31 <popey>	LXF_Andrew: a 5 minute "TipCast" is something I've been meaning to do, but never got round tuit

May 20 15:28:38 <M-Saunders>	sbox: PulseAudio makes me cry in my sleep

May 20 15:31:03 <popey>	LXF_Andrew: a 5 min tip show might go down very nicely, people could submit their own tips and you just record them

May 20 15:31:11 <JonTheNiceGuy>	That's a point popey, what was the "backing up lorry" in the last UUPC show?

May 20 15:31:17 <marxjohnson>	Evening all

May 20 15:31:17 <popey>	LXF_Andrew: the only problem is a lot of tips are command line based, and you really don't want to be reading those out

May 20 15:31:19 <JonTheNiceGuy>	It sounded like a microwave

May 20 15:31:22 <popey>	JonTheNiceGuy: that was my dishwasher

May 20 15:31:36 <cchristiansen>	LXF_Andres: Or the top program for the fortnight

May 20 15:31:56 <M-Saunders>	felimwhiteley: You missed the bit where we handed out free money

May 20 15:32:00 <M-Saunders>	felimwhiteley: Never mind though!

May 20 15:32:00 <Twister_Kuriboh>	felim: you didn't miss too much

May 20 15:32:07 <popey>	Twister_Kuriboh: try reading aloud a command with lots of pipes and ` ' and ". people will make mistakes, and it's very dry to listen to

May 20 15:32:10 <EspadaV8>	oooh, LXF_Andrew you should have a NSFW version with that included :)

May 20 15:32:10 <felimwhiteley>	M-Saunders: Son of a diddly

May 20 15:32:21 <M-Saunders>	felimwhiteley: Oh, and the secret to immortality

May 20 15:32:34 <M-Saunders>	But back to KDE vs Gnome

May 20 15:32:37 <M-Saunders>	I say Xfce wins

May 20 15:32:43 <braintooth>	agreed

May 20 15:32:44 <popey>	Unity!

May 20 15:32:44 <Darth_Tux2328>	Gnome 3

May 20 15:32:45 <towy71>	lxde

May 20 15:32:47 <popey>	heh

May 20 15:32:50 <jellyman>	KDE

May 20 15:32:50 <M-Saunders>	TekWM

May 20 15:32:52 <bobthebob1234>	they are all rubbish we need something new

May 20 15:32:53 <cchristiansen>	M-Saunders: *sighs* we sorted that out already

May 20 15:32:55 <spamsnake>	Gnome 3

May 20 15:32:55 <Twister_Kuriboh>	um... both lxde and xfce

May 20 15:32:55 <hydrantmark>	Openbox

May 20 15:33:03 <M-Saunders>	MWM

May 20 15:33:04 <popey>	Oh yeah, Lubuntu is on course to become an official Ubuntu derivative, which is cool

May 20 15:33:04 <sbox>	kde 4 here

May 20 15:33:04 <cchristiansen>	obviously KDE

May 20 15:33:04 <AndreasFrom>	just give me something GTK-based

May 20 15:33:06 <LXF_Andrew>	popey: Aye, it would be dry listening alright. We'll add that to the ideas pile in the corner of LXF Towers

May 20 15:33:17 <sbox>	and i use fluxbox to

May 20 15:33:24 <Twister_Kuriboh>	hmm... enlightenment hasn't been mentioned

May 20 15:33:34 <Darth_Tux2328>	nor has JWM

May 20 15:33:41 <sbox>	what about ratpoison?

May 20 15:33:42 <M-Saunders>	Twister_Kuriboh: That's because it has been version 0.00000000017 for a BILLION years

May 20 15:33:45 <marxjohnson>	Twister_Kuriboh: maybe there's a reason for that;-)

May 20 15:33:47 <LXF_Andrew>	Gnome 2.x for the epic boringness. 

May 20 15:33:49 <degville>	i find pulseaudio is slightly over-engineered for its purpose.

May 20 15:33:50 <hydrantmark>	nor Pink Ponies.... naturally

May 20 15:33:51 <cchristiansen>	Twister_Kuriboh: enlightenment used to be cool, no longer

May 20 15:33:54 <M-Saunders>	Twister_Kuriboh: If Rasterman would sort his stuff out and get 1.0 out of the door, that'd be better

May 20 15:33:56 <Darth_Tux2328>	but still,Gnome 3 or Openbox

May 20 15:34:00 <maxwildcat>	window maker

May 20 15:34:01 <thameslink>	I like openbox

May 20 15:34:01 <maxwildcat>	:p

May 20 15:34:02 <popey>	Go CDE!

May 20 15:34:07 <braintooth>	or icewm

May 20 15:34:10 <spamsnake>	Someone should write an IRC client for MikeOS

May 20 15:34:14 <maxwildcat>	enlightenment was cool.. is it still alive ?

May 20 15:34:16 <bobthebob1234>	lol

May 20 15:34:20 <M-Saunders>	Window Maker rules, but is quite old now too

May 20 15:34:25 <M-Saunders>	spamsnake: And a TCP/IP stack first though

May 20 15:34:27 <maxwildcat>	still running it 

May 20 15:34:37 <degville>	MikeOS is an IRC client with Mike's soul being the only server.

May 20 15:34:39 <spamsnake>	M-Saunders: Indeed, I was just thinking that

May 20 15:34:49 <spamsnake>	lol

May 20 15:34:58 <marxjohnson>	M-Saunders: use the BSD one, everyone else seems to

May 20 15:35:02 <M-Saunders>	degville: Can I use that as the official MikeOS slogan?

May 20 15:35:09 <braintooth>	maxxwildcat: I hear a bit about enlightenment every now and then but it never seems to amount to much

May 20 15:35:11 <LXF_Andrew>	MikeOS doesn't have any networking yet, so there's 100% no risk of 'computer viruseseseiiii'

May 20 15:35:16 <maxwildcat>	M-Saunders: (window maker is awesome on a remote machine you VNC to on a slow connection )

May 20 15:36:23 <AndreasFrom>	does MikeOS exist?

May 20 15:36:27 <Darth_Tux2328>	LFS?

May 20 15:36:39 <marxjohnson>	AndreasFrom: I was just thinking that - it could all be a massive hoax

May 20 15:36:47 <Twister_Kuriboh>	LFS: Linux from scratch

May 20 15:36:50 <marxjohnson>	for a given value of massive

May 20 15:37:01 <LXF_Andrew>	I don't think so. Mike meant it to be a learning exercise, so the point isn't to be the biggest or the best, just the best-commented

May 20 15:37:05 <Darth_Tux2328>	but is MikeOS from LFS?

May 20 15:37:10 <MayankSharma>	AndreasFrom, http://mikeos.berlios.de

May 20 15:37:16 <M-Saunders>	Darth_Tux2328: http://mikeos.berlios.de

May 20 15:37:23 <maxwildcat>	is mikeOS written in python where you simply import anything from the meaning of life in the universe to girls with great big t...

May 20 15:37:25 <Twister_Kuriboh>	it's a live cd with tools to aid in the developing of a linux distrobution (with the linux from scratch pdf)

May 20 15:43:48 <JonTheNiceGuy>	degville, JonRob, LXF_Andrew, M-Saunders - Any chance you guys will cover alternatives to Skype subsequent to the Microsoft purchase?

May 20 15:43:48 <cchristiansen>	they did, called chatzilla

May 20 15:43:49 <sbox>	mike how cool is that (alsa)

May 20 15:43:52 <biggles1000>	M-Saunders, i would run linux, but my system specs are too low http://www.sevenforums.com/member.php?u=86059 (mint live cd always freezes, ubuntu has failed on me too many times (declaring the hdd is dead etc.))

May 20 15:43:55 <LXF_Andrew>	felimwhiteley, as you'll know from listening to the podcast, the GNU?Linux naming section of its FAQ is longer than the US constitution. Those people need to get on with their lives

May 20 15:44:00 <M-Saunders>	mfraz74: We did "Write an IRC bot" as a Perl tutorial once, somewhere

May 20 15:44:06 <degville>	JonTheNiceGuy: tbh, i forgot. that was one of the few weeks i actually discovered something. and i've got something for next time too, but after that's i'll try to mention it!

May 20 15:53:24 <thameslink>	its a shame really I've used ubuntu to introduce 3 or 4 non techie people to linux since 9.04 and now the unity launcher I've been playing with is broken in lots of little annoyning ways that'd just put people right off.

May 20 15:53:26 <M-Saunders>	mfraz74: Arrr, Sahmerset

May 20 15:54:44 <degville>	felimwhiteley: i think the 4.4 release added tons of stuff. regex, qt (now qml would be good)... but they've just not written it down. it is powerful though, much like the rest of KDE.

May 20 15:54:45 <hudzilla>	mfraz74: Which one? :)

May 20 15:59:12 <frank_duck>	How about Hanjie instead of a crossword?

May 20 16:01:59 <LXF_Andrew>	thameslink, Are you the person who sent us the pic of a computer screen booting Fedora or something on the back of a train seat?

May 20 16:02:00 <towy71>	thameslink isn't that a trainline that doesn't work

May 20 16:02:02 <M-Saunders>	felimwhiteley: IRC without monospace fonts?! That's like listening to Bach harpsichord music on a PIANO!

May 20 16:02:10 <M-Saunders>	towy71: That's every train line

May 20 16:02:19 <thameslink>	umm no

May 20 16:02:27 <marxjohnson>	speaking of monospace fonts, whatever happened to Ubuntu Monospace?

May 20 16:02:32 <huw_>	bobthebob1234, unless it works on WINE i have no idea i'm afraid :(

May 20 16:02:33 <degville>	mfraz74: you do know that crossword was generated with ls -m /bin /sbin >crossword.txt

May 20 16:02:40 <spamsnake>	Speaking of Bach, Iwas just playing some of his work

May 20 16:02:43 <Dave2>	M-Saunders: I only had one pint :(

May 20 16:02:43 <huw_>	i'm one of those sad gits who keeps a Windows partition around for gaming

May 20 16:02:50 <Dave2>	I figured it was fine as my manager also went

May 20 16:02:53 <M-Saunders>	degville: That's how I write all of my tutorials

May 20 16:02:57 <mfraz74>	degville: That explains why I couldn't finish one

May 20 16:03:01 <AndreasFrom>	huw_: me too, it's alright though

May 20 16:03:10 <Dave2>	My mind cannot cope with the concept of this channel having activity :(

May 20 16:03:26 <huw_>	dave2 yeah, i used to frequent this place until the activity bottomed out

May 20 16:03:30 <M-Saunders>	Dave2: This changes everything. Again.

May 20 16:03:32 <huw_>	hopefully this is the start of a new era!

May 20 16:03:38 <M-Saunders>	A whole new world

May 20 16:03:39 <Dave2>	huw_: how long ago was that‽

May 20 16:03:40 <felimwhiteley>	Dave2: it's like... lug radio channel back in the day... 

May 20 16:03:41 <huw_>	i demand regular staff appearances!

May 20 16:03:46 <JonRob>	Dave2 - lol, but if a new era starts the magazine will never be published again

May 20 16:03:46 *	felimwhiteley wipes whistful tear from eye

May 20 16:03:49 <huw_>	dave2, oooo, at least a couple of years ago now

May 20 16:03:58 <Dave2>	huw_: liar, there wasn't any activity a couple of years ago.

May 20 16:04:11 <M-Saunders>	So who has the best nickname here then?

May 20 16:04:12 <Dave2>	I don't think there's been any activity in here in the time I've been here, which must've been since at least 2003

May 20 16:04:21 <huw_>	haha

May 20 16:04:21 <towy71>	me

May 20 16:04:22 <M-Saunders>	I like "hitomato"

May 20 16:04:46 <felimwhiteley>	M-Saunders: clearly me

May 20 16:04:46 <huw_>	obviously it wasn't very regular

May 20 16:04:52 <Dave2>	M-Saunders: any idea when I firstj oined?

May 20 16:04:54 <towy71>	beerw0lf looks good

May 20 16:04:56 <M-Saunders>	felimwhiteley: Is yours an anagram for something?

May 20 16:04:56 <hudzilla>	huw_: If you want degville to be active, you need to read M-Saunders's IRC Bot in Perl tutorial on TuxRadar, then write a Monome bot that lives in the channel.

May 20 16:05:05 <M-Saunders>	Dave2: I'd say, yeah, 2002/3 or thereabouts

May 20 16:05:23 <huw_>	hudzilla, oh jeez. can't i just learn about trackers instead? :D

May 20 16:06:42 <hudzilla>	huw_: Trackers are more Mike's game. If you hand Mike a screenshot of some audio waveforms and a print out from OctaMED, he could probably hum the melody.

May 20 16:06:42 <AndreasFrom>	Does LXF_Huw get payed by Future now?

May 20 16:07:15 <Dave2>	Yus.

May 20 16:07:31 <hitomato>	M-Saunders: It's supposed to be hiromato actually. Spelling mistake...

May 20 16:07:35 <hudzilla>	LXF_Huw: I think we all felt shamed when we heard Mike's fugue.

May 20 16:07:49 <mfraz74>	Oh I remember listening to trackers back when I used RISC OS

May 20 16:07:58 <LXF_Andrew>	What did I do for that challenge? Oh yes, I remember

May 20 16:13:22 <DoubleDiode>	Theme should be the Pink Pony Song

May 20 16:13:23 <LXF_Andrew>	Father Ted 'Careful Now' undermined by typo fail

May 20 16:13:24 <hudzilla>	jsm2625: That's a really important question, and I think someone ought to answer it sometime.

May 20 16:13:33 <LXF_Huw>	LXF_Andrew, shameful. tch tch

May 20 16:13:39 <braintooth>	woah, time to get mocked by my Linux useing Spanish speaking 4 year old.

May 20 16:16:41 <Darth_Tux2328>	!

May 20 16:16:41 <LXF_Huw>	M-Saunders, didn't stop Effy apparently!

May 20 16:16:43 <MikeN_>	Probably discussed this already, but how are people finding Ubuntu 11.04? Bit the bullet and installed Arch and GNOME3 last weekend. Could not get on with Unity.

May 20 16:16:44 <davmor2>	shocked to not see an anonymous penguin on this channel

May 20 16:16:44 <felimwhiteley>	cchristiansen: get off my lawn!

May 20 16:16:45 <thameslink>	well I'm about to quit my job and do an access to HE certificate which is as close as I'll ever get to sitting GCSE's

May 20 16:16:51 <LXF_Andrew>	LXF_Huw, Yeah intern, back to work

May 20 16:16:56 <LXF_Huw>	:(

May 20 16:16:56 <M-Saunders>	LXF_Huw: Effy has a gun and we're scared of him

May 20 16:16:56 <Dave2>	GCSEs were somewhat annoying. Plus if I were doing GCSEs now it'd mean I'd have to do my final year project again and I don't want to do that.

May 20 16:17:05 <LXF_Huw>	haha

May 20 16:17:17 <cchristiansen>	felimwhiteley: what? are you 15-16 as well?

May 20 16:18:17 <felimwhiteley>	AndreasFrom: bonus points to you

May 20 16:18:20 <LXF_Huw>	lol i was gonna say that gwil

May 20 16:18:24 <Dave2>	felimwhiteley's not 15-16, he uses a tea pot, and teenagers don't use those.

May 20 16:18:30 <AndreasFrom>	felimwhiteley: for what?

May 20 16:18:31 <Darth_Tux2328>	ARCH vs. SLACKWARE

May 20 16:18:40 <felimwhiteley>	Dave2: shuuut iiiiiit!

May 20 16:18:40 <M-Saunders>	Darth_Tux2328: ARCHWARE

May 20 16:18:45 <Dave2>	felimwhiteley: :(

May 20 16:18:49 <LXF_Huw>	Debian vs the WORLD! because Debian can take it :p

May 20 16:18:51 <cchristiansen>	AndreasFrom: for understanding him correctly

May 20 16:18:52 <gwil>	arch, definately

May 20 16:18:56 <AndreasFrom>	Slackarch

May 20 16:18:56 <M-Saunders>	So Linux then

May 20 16:19:00 <cchristiansen>	Arch

May 20 16:19:01 <MikeN_>	Arch

May 20 16:19:01 <M-Saunders>	How to get more market share?

May 20 16:19:05 <AndreasFrom>	cchristiansen: felimwhiteley: Ahh i see

May 20 16:19:06 <felimwhiteley>	AndreasFrom: lets say... storage

May 20 16:19:10 <Darth_Tux2328>	arch doesn't install properly for me....

May 20 16:19:11 <Dave2>	Buy shares in a market.

May 20 16:19:12 <Darth_Tux2328>	:(

May 20 16:19:18 <JonRob>	http://www.tuxradar.com/files/music/pauls_music.ogg

May 20 16:19:24 <Theodore>	Darth_Tux2328: I happen to be a fan of Slackware for years now

May 20 16:19:25 <M-Saunders>	Dave2: You win, flawless victory

May 20 16:19:28 <LXF_Huw>	M-Saunders, it won't happen, not significantly. Windows install base is too large

May 20 16:19:37 <cchristiansen>	market share? give everybody free LXF magazines >:D

May 20 16:19:41 <Darth_Tux2328>	Slackware = dependency difficulty for me

May 20 16:19:42 <degville>	M-Saunders: rename ubuntu-1104 to windows8_beta2.torrent

May 20 16:19:53 <AndreasFrom>	yeah

May 20 16:19:55 <LXF_Huw>	one thing we *could* all be doing though, is getting our MPs to press for more open-source in schools, government departments etc. that's realistic

May 20 16:19:56 <M-Saunders>	cchristiansen: You send us the money, we'll hand 'em out :-)

May 20 16:19:58 <mfraz74>	What we need is an official Linux distro for the UK like Pardus is for Turkey

May 20 16:20:03 <biggles1000>	that would make it infinity% more popuar :P

May 20 16:20:07 <Dave2>	Limebuntu

May 20 16:20:11 <LXF_Andrew>	Fair point Huw, I've ditched Ubuntu on my old laptop in favour of Debian. It just works

May 20 16:20:20 <Darth_Tux2328>	Really?

May 20 16:20:23 <LXF_Huw>	cool beans LXF_Andrew!

May 20 16:20:47 <JonRob>	so if windows > /dev/null, mac > ?

May 20 16:20:47 <Theodore>	Darth_Tux2328: I agree to some extent, but the pay-off is that it gives you full control of almost everything on the system

May 20 16:20:49 <cchristiansen>	M-Saunders: shouldn't that responsibility be shared out in the spirit of community? :)

May 20 16:20:54 <LXF_Huw>	thanks very much everyone, it was lovely chatting with you all

May 20 16:21:16 <Darth_Tux2328>	Theodore: is it that good? Maybe I should give Slack another chance?

May 20 16:21:16 <degville>	LXF_Huw: bye huw!

May 20 16:21:25 <M-Saunders>	Dave2: Er

May 20 16:21:27 <LXF_Andrew>	Bye Huw!

May 20 16:21:30 <M-Saunders>	Dave2: But I was playing Wave Race in November

May 20 16:21:34 <Dave2>	Hm.

May 20 16:21:34 <jsm2625>	jonrob: thanks

May 20 16:21:35 <Darth_Tux2328>	bye Huw

May 20 16:21:37 <felimwhiteley>	LXF_Andrew: you don't even have a Queen at the moment

May 20 16:21:37 <M-Saunders>	Dave2: My original copy with my names and records

May 20 16:21:38 <gwil>	LXF_Andrew: National food: Baked beans on toast

May 20 16:21:39 <Dave2>	It must be someone else's

May 20 16:21:41 *	M-Saunders = confusd

May 20 16:21:46 <Dave2>	Why do I have a Wave Race then?

May 20 16:21:49 <Dave2>	I never bought that game

May 20 16:21:54 <M-Saunders>	Hrm

May 20 16:21:55 <JonRob>	jsm2625?

May 20 16:21:56 <gwil>	why is mike confused?

May 20 16:22:18 <dg>	someone said there were now people in here

May 20 16:22:18 <LXF_Andrew>	Felim Why, do you want to keep her? I'll swap you for the queen of Ireland, Eamon Dunphy

May 20 16:22:23 <dg>	I was shocked

May 20 16:22:24 <Dave2>	M-Saunders: I already warned him

May 20 16:22:27 <M-Saunders>	Cool

May 20 16:22:29 <davmor2>	gwil: Dave2 got involved in a conversation with him

May 20 16:22:39 <Dave2>	M-Saunders: I know I have some game of yours, anyway

May 20 16:22:47 <M-Saunders>	Dave2: I have a Mario Party

May 20 16:22:50 <Dave2>	And I think it's Wave Race.

May 20 16:22:52 <M-Saunders>	Dave2: I'm sure that's not mine

May 20 16:22:53 <jsm2625>	JonRob: Never mind, thought you were giving me the tune.

May 20 16:22:56 <MikeN_>	I switched to Linux and I'm very happy. It does everything I want it to do and while the initial learning curve was steep, I spend a lot less time "managing" my Linux Laptop than my Windows Laptop. What joy...

May 20 16:22:57 <Darth_Tux2328>	Theodore: Ok I'll give it a try!

May 20 16:22:59 <Dave2>	M-Saunders: that one's probably mine

May 20 16:23:06 <felimwhiteley>	LXF_Andrew: no we're showing her a good time but we aren't serious, just teasing! Just hold a beer out the Window sure he'll be over in a sec

May 20 16:23:13 <JonRob>	jsm2625: well, thoough everyone would benefit

May 20 16:23:17 <M-Saunders>	Dave2: Cool. Give me a shout next time you're in Bath, and we'll have a pint and game swap if you like

May 20 16:23:22 <Darth_Tux2328>	Theodore: but a problem with Slack is that it dosen't have the unstable/devel version of Supertux

May 20 16:23:31 <M-Saunders>	Darth_Tux2328: Complain to Pat V

May 20 16:23:37 <Dave2>	M-Saunders: will do whenever I am

May 20 16:23:56 <Darth_Tux2328>	Pat V?

May 20 16:24:01 <Theodore>	Darth_Tux2328: The latest release is 13.37 and it includes KDE 4.5

May 20 16:24:04 <Dave2>	Slackware guy

May 20 16:24:10 <MikeN_>	Really got into Linux with Ubuntu and possibly "outgrown" it and now have moved on to Arch. What next, I wonder? Compiling everything from source. ;-)

May 20 16:24:19 <AndIrc_>	ah... this is the life... beer garden, Guinness, free WiFi

May 20 16:24:29 <gwil>	MikeN_: Linux from scratch FTW

May 20 16:24:29 <cchristiansen>	MikeN_++

May 20 16:25:20 <jellyman>	Cya :)

May 20 16:25:24 <Theodore>	MikeN_ : No you do not have to do that in Slack.. You get an almost complete system after the first installation

May 20 16:25:28 <LXF_Andrew>	Bye Jon, he types to the chap sitting two meters away

May 20 16:25:32 *	JonRob has quit (Quit: Lost terminal)

May 20 16:25:37 <cchristiansen>	Righhht, now time for a real question, who is your favourite person from LXF?

May 20 16:25:49 <Darth_Tux2328>	Theodore: How to update Slackware? We have one at school that is ancient (ooo 2.3, kde 3, etc...)

May 20 16:26:00 <sbox>	graham

May 20 16:26:23 <Darth_Tux2328>	What is the new guy called?

May 20 16:26:28 <Theodore>	MikeN_ : And then there is www.slackbuilds.org & www.slacky.eu where you can find any package you could possibly need

May 20 16:26:35 <cchristiansen>	jon roberts

May 20 16:26:36 <sbox>	Jonathan Roberts

May 20 16:26:42 <Darth_Tux2328>	he seems cool

May 20 16:26:48 <sbox>	agreed

May 20 16:27:08 <MikeN_>	Theodore: I meant going really hardcore and installing Linux and everything from source. 

May 20 16:27:15 <Darth_Tux2328>	almost all of the podcast people are cool, it seems

May 20 16:27:30 <M-Saunders>	Yeah

May 20 16:27:33 <sbox>	I'll be back

May 20 16:27:44 <Theodore>	Darth_Tux2328: If you have a look at the CD-ROM / directory, there is always a file called UPDATE.TXT (or UPGRADE.TXT) where the process is described in detail.

May 20 16:27:56 *	sbox has quit (Quit: Lost terminal)

May 20 16:28:04 <AndreasFrom>	Paul send be a book, so I might be kinda biased :) *falls deeper in love with the Linux community*

May 20 16:28:14 <Theodore>	Darth_Tux2328: You do not need to reformat/reinstall etc

May 20 16:28:20 <mcnalu>	Theodore, MikeN_ : oh slackware. I too am a slacker. Recommend sbopkg.

May 20 16:28:28 <hudzilla>	AndreasFrom: I hope you're getting the chance to use it!

May 20 16:28:35 <Darth_Tux2328>	Theodore: cool, thanks. But I don't think i can update anything without superuser privileges

May 20 16:29:24 <Darth_Tux2328>	darn.

May 20 16:29:46 <Darth_Tux2328>	degville: there were no Linux stickers in LXF 144 for me

May 20 16:30:02 <AndreasFrom>	was LXF144 supposed to have stickers?

May 20 16:30:04 <Darth_Tux2328>	degville: were there supposed to be?

May 20 16:30:11 <hudzilla>	AndreasFrom: Great! The more you write, the bigger your own personal code stash will become. Sooner or later you'll have enough code already written that you can put things together super-quick.

May 20 16:30:12 <popey>	Stickers!?

May 20 16:30:21 <popey>	I'll keep it away from my 4 year old

May 20 16:30:31 <popey>	his bedroom door is covered in any stickers he finds

May 20 16:30:42 <Darth_Tux2328>	because it's the first time an LXF magazine has not come with anything bonus

May 20 16:30:50 <mfraz74>	popey: My daughter is the same

May 20 16:30:52 <Theodore>	Darth_Tux2328: But surprisingly, I have even managed to upgrade from 32bit to 64bit without reinstalling all apps.. Imagine this happening on Windows!!!!

May 20 16:30:57 <davmor2>	M-Saunders: Challenge an lxf lfs

May 20 16:31:05 <thameslink>	I got those stickers, my daughter stuck them all over my misses laptop she... wasn't pleased

May 20 16:31:13 <M-Saunders>	davmor2: Challenge an LXF to LFS?

May 20 16:31:15 <M-Saunders>	Huh?

May 20 16:31:18 <Darth_Tux2328>	(booklet, poster, 'coding academy' thing)

May 20 16:31:20 <AndreasFrom>	hudzilla: Yeah :) I've got "reading for exams" -holiday next week, am going to finish it then.

May 20 16:31:43 <davmor2>	M-Saunders: A LXF linux from scatch

May 20 16:31:44 <Darth_Tux2328>	Thedore: wow! I don't think I've even ever used 64 bit windows

May 20 16:31:47 <AndreasFrom>	hudzilla: Plus, this damn 3x3x3 cube steals all my time :D

May 20 16:32:07 <Darth_Tux2328>	ooops: Theodore:

May 20 16:32:12 <M-Saunders>	davmor2: Might be nice if we had the luxury of all that time :-)

May 20 16:32:24 <mfraz74>	Only 64 bit linux I run is on my server

May 20 16:32:27 <davmor2>	M-Saunders: HAHA

May 20 16:32:30 <felimwhiteley>	M-Saunders: btw are you using your festival powered IRC clinet? Actually could use one here to work and listen in here..

May 20 16:32:33 <degville>	Darth_Tux2328: there were supposed to be stickers in the US edition.

May 20 16:32:38 <gwil>	I'm wondering, which OS projects is the best for a contribution. The problem is that I know ruby and very few, well used projects are written in it. I know a bit of C++ with Qt. Does anyone here have a C++/Qt project they wouldn't mind me helping with?

May 20 16:32:42 <hudzilla>	AndreasFrom: I hope you have a good cube. My own speed cube is so nice compared to the nasty official ones.

May 20 16:32:51 <Darth_Tux2328>	degville: ah, I guess that explains it

May 20 16:33:01 <Darth_Tux2328>	degville: that's too bad

May 20 16:33:08 <M-Saunders>	felimwhiteley: I was just looking for the code, but sadly I don't have it on my work machine :-(

May 20 16:33:12 <gwil>	I keep starting my own projects but neve finishing them. I'm sure its the same with everyone though

May 20 16:33:19 <felimwhiteley>	doh

May 20 16:33:30 <Theodore>	I am sorry but I have to leave now.. It was really nice to be here for the first time!!!!! 

May 20 16:33:38 <Darth_Tux2328>	QUESTION: how supported are Macs for Linux?

May 20 16:33:42 <M-Saunders>	gwil: I think on Freshmeat you can search by language, and see if there are any projects that need help

May 20 16:33:45 <AndreasFrom>	hudzilla: I've just got an off. Rubik's one, but I've lubed it. I hit 28.6 sec. yesterday. New personal best and it was in front of my class :)

May 20 16:33:46 <M-Saunders>	Theodore: Bye!

May 20 16:33:47 <Darth_Tux2328>	Theodore: thanks for your suggestions

May 20 16:33:49 <davmor2>	M-Saunders: you have the advantage of being able to use the xfcd excuse for having sword fights in the office though (code compiling)

May 20 16:33:56 <Darth_Tux2328>	Theodore: ciao!

May 20 16:34:01 <M-Saunders>	davmor2: We have sword fights in the office anyway

May 20 16:34:06 <Theodore>	I promiss to be back next time

May 20 16:34:09 <M-Saunders>	davmor2: As stress relief

May 20 16:34:13 <Theodore>	Glad to see you all

May 20 16:34:40 <LXF_Andrew>	Ciao everybody, I'm off to join Effy at the water slide

May 20 16:34:42 <M-Saunders>	davmor2: I carved the MikeOS cat logo into Andrew's chest in a fit of rage once

May 20 16:34:52 <degville>	Darth_Tux2328: i'll mention it to our magazine team and see whether we can do the same thing for other regions.

May 20 16:36:00 <M-Saunders>	gwil: End of Flash coming, methinks

May 20 16:36:01 <Theodore>	This applies to anybody

May 20 16:36:06 <cchristiansen>	is it all HTML5?

May 20 16:36:08 <Theodore>	Bye

May 20 16:36:09 <M-Saunders>	And too right -- Flash is terrible (well, the plugin)

May 20 16:36:10 <AndreasFrom>	There are a lot of things going on with JS these days

May 20 16:36:12 *	Theodore has quit (Quit: Leaving)

May 20 16:36:14 <cchristiansen>	and javascipt?

May 20 16:36:36 <felimwhiteley>	hmm I played it in FF4 would that have been flash or JS.. I didn't really look

May 20 16:36:50 <davmor2>	M-Saunders: best browser to play angry birds in as a challenge :D

May 20 16:37:41 <hudzilla>	MayankSharma: Hello, BTW :)

May 20 16:37:52 <MayankSharma>	you (we, everyone) should do this more often

May 20 16:37:52 <M-Saunders>	Darth_Tux2328: Nevar!

May 20 16:38:03 <MayankSharma>	hi hudzilla

May 20 16:38:09 <mfraz74>	hudzilla: Think I'll treat myself to a cider instead

May 20 16:38:19 <Darth_Tux2328>	M-Saunders: cool

May 20 16:38:23 <gwil>	cchristiansen, M-Saunders: Pretty much and yes, the end if flash is neigh. :)

May 20 16:38:36 <hudzilla>	MayankSharma: Are you firing on all cylinders nowadays?

May 20 16:38:50 <MayankSharma>	I imagined this would be more verbose than email but...

May 20 16:38:56 <cchristiansen>	The day when Flash is obsolete will be one of the most important days in the history of LInux!

May 20 16:39:07 <gwil>	M-Saunders: How do I find projects which would like help on freshmeat?

May 20 16:39:14 <AndreasFrom>	gwil: Flash is always neigh. It's everywhere! /deliberate misunderstanding

May 20 16:39:14 <M-Saunders>	cchristiansen: And the interwebs in general I think

May 20 16:39:25 <M-Saunders>	gwil: Dunno. Find project, see website, see if asking for help, I guesss

May 20 16:39:47 <MayankSharma>	oh yes hudzilla and degville and Andrew are making sure that I do :)

May 20 16:40:50 <felimwhiteley>	ohhhh sweeet

May 20 16:41:36 <felimwhiteley>	M-Saunders: Dublin

May 20 16:41:37 <hudzilla>	degville: I'm certainly busy. I have more meetings nowadays. I have people who actually send meeting invites into my calendar rather than use email. It's a bit strange.

May 20 16:41:51 <jellyman>	Anyway guys nice talking to you all, I hope we do this again :)

May 20 16:42:01 <EspadaV8>	i think it's time i head off

May 20 16:42:11 <M-Saunders>	jellyman: Bye

May 20 16:42:11 <EspadaV8>	just realised it's 2am nearly :-S

May 20 16:42:17 <thameslink>	Well I have to go, but before I do, I came here to say something. The work you have done has been an important part of re-igniting my interest in computers. Ultimately this has led to my decision to leave my job and go and study something I'm interested in rather than spend my life chasing a pay check, so I know it's your job and you're paid to do this and everything but you've all been instrumental in a substant

May 20 16:42:22 <M-Saunders>	EspadaV8: Where are you?

May 20 16:42:36 <cchristiansen>	what IRC clients have the LXF team been reviewing by the way?

May 20 16:43:34 <Darth_Tux2328>	on the website

May 20 16:43:37 <Darth_Tux2328>	in the game

May 20 16:43:46 <mfraz74>	OK, I'm off now too

May 20 16:46:00 <M-Saunders>	Really?!

May 20 16:46:05 <Darth_Tux2328>	Yeah.

May 20 16:46:13 <M-Saunders>	It looked mentally hard from the bit I played

May 20 16:46:17 <jemark>	im a download fedora 15 beta now

May 20 16:46:20 <M-Saunders>	How long is it? How many levels?

May 20 16:46:28 <Darth_Tux2328>	4 levels I believe

May 20 16:46:44 <Darth_Tux2328>	(at least the version I found)

May 20 16:46:56 <Darth_Tux2328>	The end is awesome, but really hard

May 20 16:47:17 <M-Saunders>	I'm scared I'll have nightmares, after playing it again

May 20 16:47:27 <Darth_Tux2328>	you have to get a robot to throw a mushroom at the evil cat

May 20 16:47:38 <Darth_Tux2328>	withought letting the cat cut the bridge

May 20 16:47:54 <Darth_Tux2328>	or being squished by the ceiling falling on you

May 20 16:48:26 <Darth_Tux2328>	And at the end, instead of Princess Peach, there is a chicken-man

May 20 16:48:36 <Darth_Tux2328>	that part I don't get

May 20 16:51:55 <AndreasFrom>	and we thought only Canonical were paying you guys...

May 20 16:52:06 <nucc1>	Darth_Tux2328, never heard of that one

May 20 16:52:27 <hudzilla>	AndreasFrom: It's true; I haven't been so well off financially since I left LXF. I'm really missing the Canonical money :/

May 20 16:52:30 <AndreasFrom>	M-Saunders: Good point

May 20 16:52:45 <Darth_Tux2328>	nucc1: will see about crafty

May 20 16:52:55 <degville>	We took a hit when they used our beer money to develop Unity.

May 20 16:52:56 <AndreasFrom>	hudzilla: And the MS money as well? Or is that just Mike?

May 20 16:53:12 <Darth_Tux2328>	nucc1: is there a Linux chess engine that has realistically beatable levels of play?

May 20 16:53:12 <hudzilla>	degville: Fat lot of good it did them.

May 20 16:53:15 <M-Saunders>	AndreasFrom: I'm getting money from Mike-O-Soft

May 20 16:53:18 <AndreasFrom>	Beer is worth more than Unity.

May 20 16:53:31 <hudzilla>	AndreasFrom: Microsoft has never paid me any money. Mostly because I filled out their tax form incorrectly.

May 20 16:53:38 <cchristiansen>	M-Saunders: That's the poorest joke you've said all day

May 20 16:53:39 <hudzilla>	AndreasFrom: That's actually true, by the way :)

May 20 16:53:46 <AndreasFrom>	M-Saunders: You should make that company.

May 20 16:53:55 <M-Saunders>	cchristiansen: And there was a lot of competition!

May 20 16:54:34 <hudzilla>	AndreasFrom: Not pay *to* Microsoft; more that before they can pay me, they had to have the form back so they can pay the right amount to the IRS in the US.

May 20 16:54:36 <hydrantmark>	M-Saunders: Mike-O-Soft? That reminds me of the episode of The Simpsons where Homer and Granpa take over a pub in Ireland

May 20 16:56:17 <AndreasFrom>	magda: Linux Format did one I think

May 20 16:56:23 <hudzilla>	AndreasFrom: Actually, not sadly - I don't mind paying tax.

May 20 16:56:44 *	DoubleDiode (~DoubleDio@2.97.35.85) has left #linuxformat

May 20 16:56:47 <bobthebob1234>	Darth_Tux2328: there seems to be some companies out there that let you. Don't know if win free

May 20 16:56:55 <cchristiansen>	hudzilla: but you don't live in Denmark, the country with the highest taxation rate, almost

May 20 16:57:10 <Darth_Tux2328>	bobthebob1234: it would be nice

May 20 16:57:12 <AndreasFrom>	hudzilla: Yeah like the tuple of death and online flamewars. /end of LXF144 Graham qoute

May 20 16:57:30 <AndreasFrom>	Go Denmark!! We just need a new government...

May 20 16:57:31 <Darth_Tux2328>	The 'Linux Emporium' seems perfect, but I want to change the keyboard layout

May 20 16:57:34 <hudzilla>	cchristiansen: That wouldn't really bother me. If you're getting taxed a lot, there are probably other folks that need it more :)

May 20 16:57:50 <bobthebob1234>	Darth_Tux2328: Don't know where you are from but http://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/notebooks/enigmaIII-520/ seems to let you select no os. Never used them though

May 20 16:58:05 <bobthebob1234>	or just get some keyboard stickers :D

May 20 16:58:25 <AndreasFrom>	Once you understand the benefit of taxes, I don't think they hurt as much. if even still

May 20 16:58:39 <magda>	AndreasForm - I know ,I would like something broader without having to buy a text book about SELinux.

May 20 16:58:45 <cchristiansen>	hudzilla: I won't mind tax when I pay it, so long as the money's spent probably

May 20 16:58:53 <AndreasFrom>	I'm making weird sentences today...

May 20 16:58:56 <Darth_Tux2328>	the problem with keyboard stickers is that there's nowhere to put the accented keys

May 20 16:59:02 <AndreasFrom>	magda: Oh okay

May 20 16:59:06 <Darth_Tux2328>	èòàùéç

May 20 16:59:59 <degville>	ok. I've got to go and get my train. it's been fantastic though - we should do it again! have a great weekend everyone!

May 20 17:00:01 <hudzilla>	Darth_Tux2328: You should get a keyboard overlay, like all good Amiga games used to have.

May 20 17:00:12 <M-Saunders>	Ah, the Amiga

May 20 17:00:15 <Darth_Tux2328>	hudzilla: what's that?

May 20 17:00:19 *	degville has quit (Remote host closed the connection)

May 20 17:00:24 <hudzilla>	M-Saunders: Sorry for bringing it up, Mike.

May 20 17:00:30 *	M-Saunders sheds a tear

May 20 17:00:34 <M-Saunders>	Them were't days

May 20 17:00:54 <hudzilla>	Hmm. It's approaching pub o'clock.

May 20 17:00:56 <AndreasFrom>	How do you do those message things?

May 20 17:01:05 <M-Saunders>	/me does something

May 20 17:01:23 <AndreasFrom>	ahh thanks. 2nd day on IRC :)

May 20 17:01:31 <Darth_Tux2328>	degville: what's a keyboard overlay???

May 20 17:01:33 <Darth_Tux2328>	?

May 20 17:01:43 *	AndreasFrom thanks M-Saunders for the info

May 20 17:02:01 *	minino has quit (Quit: Ex-Chat)

May 20 17:02:15 <M-Saunders>	Keine Ursache!

May 20 17:02:22 <hudzilla>	Darth_Tux2328: In The Old Days, when you played games, the buttons on your keyboard did various stuff. For example, F6 might toggle the flaps on your plane whereas F8 might turn on the afterburner.

May 20 17:02:33 <cchristiansen>	M-Saunders: German and Danish aren't the same thing ;)

May 20 17:02:35 *	AndreasFrom tries to resist the urge of scrambling his cube for the 10th time this hour

May 20 17:02:37 *	cheu (~cheu@c-174-56-81-207.hsd1.nm.comcast.net) has joined #linuxformat

May 20 17:02:38 <hudzilla>	Darth_Tux2328: Clearly remembering all this was rubbish, so keyboard overlays just wrote what all those things did over the keys.

May 20 17:02:45 <M-Saunders>	cchristiansen: Danish is just German pronounced badly :-)

May 20 17:02:49 <Darth_Tux2328>	hudzilla: Ahhh, ok! thanks!

May 20 17:02:58 <AndreasFrom>	M-Saunders: Or the other way around :P

May 20 17:03:08 <cchristiansen>	AndreasFrom++

May 20 17:03:13 <M-Saunders>	And with those 'o' things with lines through them

May 20 17:03:18 <AndreasFrom>	Ø

May 20 17:03:33 <AndreasFrom>	they're awesome. We've got Æ and Å aswell

May 20 17:03:33 <M-Saunders>	Yeah, those things

May 20 17:03:42 <M-Saunders>	What's the deal? How do you pronounce them?

May 20 17:03:42 <AndreasFrom>	no umlauts though

May 20 17:03:50 <hudzilla>	AndreasFrom: To make that argument, you'd need to argue that German was a Denmarkic language or something ;)

May 20 17:03:55 <AndreasFrom>	Æ is like AE

May 20 17:04:11 <cchristiansen>	M-Saunders: I wouldn't try to pronounce Danish...

May 20 17:04:25 <AndreasFrom>	Æ is like AE in "heart"

May 20 17:04:28 <cchristiansen>	rød grød med flød, try that out ;)

May 20 17:04:30 <M-Saunders>	OK

May 20 17:04:32 <M-Saunders>	I'll try not to

May 20 17:04:40 <magda>	Any good linux podcasts out there? like the linux action show .

May 20 17:04:42 <AndreasFrom>	Ø is like "uhh"

May 20 17:05:01 <AndreasFrom>	I've got no good explanation for å, that's just weird

May 20 17:05:02 <M-Saunders>	Like ö in German?

May 20 17:05:09 <AndreasFrom>	yeah of course!

May 20 17:05:16 <cchristiansen>	ø = ö

May 20 17:05:18 <AndreasFrom>	ø and ö

May 20 17:05:18 <M-Saunders>	Gotcha

May 20 17:05:27 <hudzilla>	IRC is so much more humorous when your IRC client ignores non-ASCII characters.

May 20 17:05:38 <hudzilla>	AndreasFrom: So, are you saying then that ? and ? are both pronounced like ? in Danish?

May 20 17:05:41 <M-Saunders>	hudzilla: What client are you using?

May 20 17:05:46 >hudzilla<	CTCP VERSION

May 20 17:05:47 -hudzilla-	VERSION irssi v0.8.14

May 20 17:05:54 <M-Saunders>	Ah, Irssi

May 20 17:05:57 <AndreasFrom>	actually æ/Æ is like the first 'e' in "everything"

May 20 17:06:15 <cchristiansen>	M-Saunders: what client are you using?

May 20 17:06:20 <M-Saunders>	cchristiansen: X-Chat

May 20 17:06:34 <cchristiansen>	any good?

May 20 17:06:40 <AndreasFrom>	hudzilla: no I'm saying that X and x are both pronounced like z/Z in Danish

May 20 17:06:44 <M-Saunders>	Yeah, does a decent job. Fits in well with Xfce

May 20 17:06:50 <AndreasFrom>	XChat as well

May 20 17:06:52 <magda>	pls point me to them , many podcasts have pod faded and are off the air .

May 20 17:06:59 <Darth_Tux2328>	Xchat+Gnome=nice

May 20 17:07:05 <AndreasFrom>	used irssi yesterday though

May 20 17:07:15 <M-Saunders>	I used to use Irssi back in the day

May 20 17:07:20 <M-Saunders>	Is BitchX still being updated?

May 20 17:07:30 <cchristiansen>	AndreasFrom: which is better?

May 20 17:07:50 <hudzilla>	M-Saunders: If you call a Sourceforge project "being updated", then yes.

May 20 17:08:09 <AndreasFrom>	cchristiansen: irssi was awesome when I just had a text prompt in front of me, on Gnome though I prefer XChat

May 20 17:08:44 <AndreasFrom>	Well I need to eat now, It has been truly awesome though. Again, this community rocks!

May 20 17:08:49 <asdfas2wefw1>	Has there been a review of FOSS SIP clients yet?

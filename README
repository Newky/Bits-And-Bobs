Bits and bobs i hacked together

Mostly rubbish/interesting hacks

Some for useful stuff!!

~~~~~~~~brain_screw.pl~~~~~~~~~~~

This perl program simply converts a brain fcuk program
into a c program, it takes input from stdin and outputs to stdout
I've included the hello world example from wikipedia

An example way to run the script would be:

cat hello_world.bf | perl brain_screw.pl > out.c && gcc -o test out.c && ./test

You should see hello world ! hahah :D 

~~~~~~~~~~quick_tex.pl~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Incomplete and heavily broken( if you use many mathsy symbols) perl plugin that makes writing
latex quick notes or documents a breeze.

Particularly good if you just want a simple article or some sort of project page!

WARNING: DEALS BADLY WITH MATHS

Any latex symbols can be directly put into the source and they will be preserved.

It quite simply removes the harder syntax for a simpler syntax:

for example heres what a file should look like for use with quick_tex.pl:

t: This is my title
a: I am the author
d: Date goes here

sect: This is a section

li:
- each
- of 
- these 
- are 
- items 
- in the list
eli:

This is just normal text as you would right but can include latex symbols such as \langle or \rightarrow :)

~~~~~~~~~~done.pl~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Done is a todo list (see what i did there)

The reason why this is here is because its self editing!

It prints all the todo's as comments to the end of the file

display prints the comments

del goes through and asks what todo u want to del

it then uses sed to remove line numbers 

I think its pretty nice :)

~~~~~~~~~~~tagadd & tagls~~~~

Yet another perl hack for tag support,

I read an interesting article http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/talking-point-could-linux-abandon-directories-favour-tagging

And it got me thinking, this is my first attempt at a tagging system!

Its deeply flawed but its a starter point!

to add a tag

./tagadd <file or folder name> <tag>

to list 

./tagls <tag>

~~~~~WEBCAM AND STUFF~~~~~

simple_webcam_grab.py
webcam.py

These are two different attempts at messing with webcam on linux, basically they are just opencv python bindings and the majority of the code in webcam.py is taken from sources on the web. Mainly this one http://www.jperla.com/blog/post/capturing-frames-from-a-webcam-on-linux

The simple webcam grab just takes a single frame from the webcam and stores it to the current directory under a timestamp or else uses the filename if provided in the first parameter.

The point of this script is so that you can use it with other scripts/or perhaps a cron tab to take a webcam photo every x amount of seconds on a server perhaps.

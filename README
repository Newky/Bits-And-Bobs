Bits and bobs i hacked together

Mostly rubbish/interesting hacks

Some for useful stuff!!

~~~~~~~~brain_screw.pl~~~~~~~~~~~

This perl program simply converts a brain fcuk program
into a c program, it takes input from stdin and outputs to stdout
I've included the hello world example from wikipedia

An example way to run the script would be:

cat hello_world.bf | perl brain_screw.pl > out.c && gcc -o test out.c && ./test

You should see hello world ! hahah :D 

~~~~~~~~~~quick_tex.pl~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Incomplete and heavily broken( if you use many mathsy symbols) perl plugin that makes writing
latex quick notes or documents a breeze.

Particularly good if you just want a simple article or some sort of project page!

WARNING: DEALS BADLY WITH MATHS

Any latex symbols can be directly put into the source and they will be preserved.

It quite simply removes the harder syntax for a simpler syntax:

for example heres what a file should look like for use with quick_tex.pl:

t: This is my title
a: I am the author
d: Date goes here

sect: This is a section

li:
- each
- of 
- these 
- are 
- items 
- in the list
eli:

This is just normal text as you would right but can include latex symbols such as \langle or \rightarrow :)

Bits and bobs i hacked together

Mostly rubbish/interesting hacks

Some for useful stuff!!

~~~~~~~~brain_screw.pl~~~~~~~~~~~

This perl program simply converts a brain fcuk program
into a c program, it takes input from stdin and outputs to stdout
I've included the hello world example from wikipedia

An example way to run the script would be:

cat hello_world.bf | perl brain_screw.pl > out.c && gcc -o test out.c && ./test

You should see hello world ! hahah :D
